    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>A regional manufacturer integrated Accounts Payable and receivable systems using n8n. Automated invoice routing and AR follow-ups reduced processing costs by 25% while keeping the call center updated in real time.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>About the Client</h2>
    <p>The manufacturer produces specialty electronic components for industrial machinery. With distribution across North America and a lean administrative team, the company relies heavily on timely data to keep production and shipping on schedule. Prior to automation, finance staff manually entered invoices, leading to frequent delays and errors.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>The In-Depth Challenge</h2>
    <p>Manual coordination between AP and AR teams caused delays and inconsistent updates for the call center. Staff toggled between spreadsheets and legacy ERPs, often duplicating work. As order volume grew 15% year over year, the finance team struggled to keep up, resulting in misapplied payments and frustrated customers.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>A Technical Deep Dive</h2>
    <p>We built an n8n workflow that synchronized data across finance systems and triggered real-time notifications. The project began with a discovery phase mapping all data sources, from the ERP to customer ticketing. We developed custom n8n nodes in TypeScript to connect to a proprietary payment gateway. The workflow orchestrated invoice ingestion, validation, and posting to the accounting system. When payments were overdue, automatic reminders were dispatched via Slack and email using templated messages.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable Results and ROI</h2>
    <p>Processing costs dropped by 25% and call center agents received up-to-date account information. Average days sales outstanding decreased from 45 to 32, freeing cash flow to fund expansion. After six months, the project delivered a 200% return on investment.</p>
