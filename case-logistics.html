    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>A global freight company needed to better track shipments and automate customs paperwork. ExpertTech deployed an AI-driven document processing pipeline that cut clearance times in half and provided end-to-end visibility across the supply chain.</p>
    <p>The project unified disparate tracking systems and gave dispatchers a single dashboard for monitoring container status. Delays caused by missing paperwork are now the exception rather than the rule.</p>

    <h2>About the Client</h2>
    <p>The company manages ocean and air freight for dozens of multinational manufacturers. Each shipment generates stacks of documents that must be processed quickly to avoid costly delays at ports and airports.</p>
    <p>Prior to automation, teams manually entered data from bills of lading and customs forms, leading to frequent errors and hold-ups.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Manual data entry created significant bottlenecks. Customs agents regularly flagged paperwork, causing containers to sit idle at ports. Management needed a scalable approach to capture and validate documents in multiple languages and formats.</p>
    <p>They also wanted real-time status updates so customers could track shipments with confidence.</p>

    <h2>Technical Deep Dive</h2>
    <p>Our solution combined OCR with translation APIs and a machine learning model trained on historical shipping forms. Documents are automatically classified, relevant fields extracted, and customs submissions generated on the fly. A centralized dashboard aggregates data from carriers, providing a clear picture of every shipment.</p>
    <p>The diagram below illustrates the workflow and highlights how we integrate with partner systems to receive updates as cargo moves through the supply chain.</p>

    <h2>Results & ROI</h2>
    <p>By automating document processing, clearance time per shipment dropped by 50%. The company saved more than $2M in demurrage fees in the first year and gained a reputation for on-time deliveries.</p>
    <p>Dispatchers now rely on real-time analytics to anticipate delays and reroute shipments proactively, further increasing customer satisfaction.</p>
