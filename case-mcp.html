    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>A major insurance provider wanted stronger oversight of the AI models powering its claims and billing operations. ExpertTech installed a Model Control Platform (MCP) that tracks every model version and monitors performance metrics in real time. With automated audit trails, the company now demonstrates compliance with industry regulations effortlessly.</p>
    <p>The MCP integrates seamlessly with existing workflows, providing dashboards that highlight anomalies and alert stakeholders to potential risks. This proactive approach ensures models remain accurate and transparent at scale.</p>

    <h2>About the Client</h2>
    <p>The insurer manages millions of policies across several business lines. Prior to adopting the MCP, they relied on ad hoc spreadsheets to document model updates, making regulatory reporting difficult and time consuming.</p>
    <p>Executives needed a centralized system to enforce governance policies while still enabling data scientists to innovate rapidly.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Regulators increasingly scrutinize AI-driven financial decisions. The client lacked a standardized way to capture how models were trained, tested, and deployed. Without visibility, it was hard to prove compliance or identify underperforming models before they impacted customers.</p>
    <p>Any solution had to integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines and support complex approval workflows involving multiple departments.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Deep Dive</h2>
    <p>ExpertTech&rsquo;s MCP uses containerized services to log model metadata from the moment data scientists push a new version. We set up role-based access controls and automated notifications so stakeholders receive signoff requests as models move from staging to production. Metrics are stored in a time-series database for long-term analysis.</p>
    <p>The diagram below illustrates how model runs, metrics, and approvals flow through the platform. Integration with the client&rsquo;s existing BI tools provides a unified view of model ROI.</p>

    <h2>Results & ROI</h2>
    <p>Compliance reporting that once took days now completes in minutes. The company has avoided costly fines by quickly identifying drift and documenting every change. Managers also gained confidence to expand AI initiatives knowing they have full traceability.</p>
    <p>The MCP has proven its worth across departments, from underwriting to fraud detection, by streamlining approval cycles and improving model quality.</p>
