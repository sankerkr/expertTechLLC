  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>An insurance company adopted our Model Control Platform (MCP) to track AI performance and compliance. The platform provided dashboards for call center metrics and ensured auditability across AP and AR automation flows.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>About the Client</h2>
    <p>The insurer has operated for over 40 years and manages policies for hundreds of thousands of customers. With strict regulatory obligations, they require detailed oversight of every automated decision. As they expanded AI across underwriting and claims, leadership needed a central hub for governance.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>The In-Depth Challenge</h2>
    <p>Management needed consistent governance of AI models used in financial workflows. Each department used different tooling and logging practices, resulting in fragmented audits and delays when regulators requested data. Without a unified picture, it was nearly impossible to evaluate model drift or fairness metrics.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>A Technical Deep Dive</h2>
    <p>We deployed an MCP that logged model activity and visualized performance in real-time dashboards. The system ingested events from Python services and cloud-based APIs, storing them in a centralized warehouse for analysis. We also integrated automated alerts to notify data scientists when anomaly thresholds were breached. Below is an illustration of the platform architecture.</p>

    <p>Compliance reporting became effortless and teams gained clear insight into model ROI. The insurer reduced audit preparation time by 70% and avoided costly penalties thanks to proactive monitoring.</p>
