  <section>
    <h2>About the Client</h2>
    <p>The retailer operates a large online marketplace with thousands of daily customer inquiries. Support channels include chat, email, and social media, and consistency across these touch points is essential to maintaining brand loyalty. Prior to engaging ExpertTech, the call center relied on generic prompts that often missed the mark for product-specific questions.</p>

    <h2>The In-Depth Challenge</h2>
    <p>Generic prompts produced inconsistent answers that frustrated customers and agents. The company noticed an uptick in escalations and lengthy chat sessions. Training new agents took considerable time because they needed to learn when to override the chatbot's suggestions. The business wanted a scalable approach that could evolve with new product releases and seasonal promotions.</p>

    <h2>A Technical Deep Dive</h2>
    <p>We analyzed historic conversations and crafted optimized prompts that handled complex questions. Our team fine-tuned a Llama 3 model on anonymized chat logs, focusing on phrase variations that frequently confused the bot. We then implemented a prompt chaining system that guided the model through problem identification, troubleshooting steps, and personalized upsell opportunities. The entire workflow was deployed through a containerized API, allowing seamless updates as new training data arrived.</p>

    <p>Accuracy jumped by 30% while onboarding time for new agents was dramatically reduced. The call center now resolves 80% of inquiries without human intervention, saving an estimated $350k in annual staffing costs and increasing customer satisfaction scores by 12 points.</p>
