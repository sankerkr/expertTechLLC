    <h1>Token Optimization</h1>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>For a logistics provider processing thousands of invoices, optimized prompts cut token usage by 40%. The resulting API savings lowered monthly spend while keeping accuracy high.</p>

    <h2>About the Client</h2>
    <p>Our client manages warehousing and last-mile delivery for hundreds of online retailers. With operations spread across multiple time zones, their internal support chatbot sees constant activity from drivers and dispatchers looking for shipment updates.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>The In-Depth Challenge</h2>
    <p>Verbose prompts were inflating API costs and slowing response times. The bot often included unnecessary system messages that consumed tokens without adding value. Over the course of a month, usage exceeded budget by 60% and forced the company to throttle interactions, frustrating the fleet.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>A Technical Deep Dive</h2>
    <p>We refined prompts and implemented caching so only essential tokens were sent to the model. First, we audited chat logs to identify common intents and trimmed boilerplate text. We introduced embeddings-based similarity search to retrieve previous responses, avoiding repeated calls to the API. Additionally, a custom middleware layer compressed large location payloads into short tokens. The diagram below shows how the caching layer routes requests.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable Results and ROI</h2>
    <p>Token usage fell by 40%, delivering significant monthly savings. Response times improved by 50%, leading to faster dispatch decisions and happier drivers. Within four months, the project paid for itself.</p>
