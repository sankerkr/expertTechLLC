    <h1>Agentic Workflows</h1>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>A telecom provider used agentic workflows to triage support tickets. Agents coordinate autonomously to classify issues, retrieve account data and escalate when needed, improving service levels and reducing call transfers.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>About the Client</h2>
    <p>The client is a rapidly growing mobile carrier with millions of subscribers. Their contact center fields tens of thousands of calls every day, so even a small gain in efficiency translates into significant savings. Traditional call routing could not keep up with the scale or complexity of requests.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>The In-Depth Challenge</h2>
    <p>High ticket volume made manual triage slow and error-prone. Agents needed to dig through multiple systems to verify identity and account details. Customers were bounced between departments, leading to poor satisfaction scores. The carrier sought an AI-driven approach that could automate categorization and ensure that live agents received complete context when needed.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>A Technical Deep Dive</h2>
    <p>We deployed a multi-agent workflow to classify requests, pull account information and escalate critical issues automatically. The workflow relied on a combination of natural language understanding and rule-based routing. Each agent communicated through a central message bus, sharing metadata such as customer ID and conversation history. A dedicated escalation agent monitored sentiment and compliance triggers, connecting the caller to a specialist when required. The diagram below showcases the architecture and communication paths.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable Results and ROI</h2>
    <p>Call transfers dropped sharply and service levels improved. The system handled 60% of incoming tickets without human intervention, reducing average handle time by 2 minutes and saving an estimated $1M annually.</p>
