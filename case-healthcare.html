    <h1>Healthcare Automation</h1>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>A regional healthcare network sought to streamline patient appointment scheduling and insurance verification. By implementing an AI-driven workflow, they reduced manual administrative work, improved patient satisfaction, and accelerated revenue collection.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>About the Client</h2>
    <p>The network operates six clinics and two hospitals, serving thousands of patients each month. Before automation, staff juggled phone calls, emails, and paper forms to coordinate appointments and confirm insurance coverage.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>The In-Depth Challenge</h2>
    <p>Manual processes often resulted in double bookings and delayed approvals from insurers. Patients had to wait on hold to reschedule appointments or clarify coverage. These inefficiencies increased no-shows and slowed down claims processing.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>A Technical Deep Dive</h2>
    <p>ExpertTech built a secure scheduling assistant using conversational AI integrated with the existing EHR system. Insurance documents were processed with OCR and validated against payer APIs. A rules engine handled edge cases such as referrals and prior authorizations.</p>
    <p>Below is a simplified architecture diagram of the solution.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable Results and ROI</h2>
    <p>Within two months, automated appointment reminders decreased no-shows by 20%. Insurance verification time dropped from days to minutes, which accelerated revenue by $1.2M in the first year.</p>
